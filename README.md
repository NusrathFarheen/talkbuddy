# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note
This project is hosted on Render's free tier, which causes the server to "spin down" (go to sleep) after 15 minutes of inactivity.

If the app doesn't respond on your first try, please wait about 30-60 seconds for the server to wake up and then try speaking again. It's not a bug, it's a feature of free hosting!
